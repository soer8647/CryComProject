# CryComProject
In order to use the project, the Cryptopp library needs to be installed.
To compile the project, simply use "make".
To run it, one only needs to run the main file, which is the output of the compilation.

Our main method is located in the test.cpp file. From this we can run any of our tests, 
however, these are by default disabled, by being commented out.
